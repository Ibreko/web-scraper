# CVE Information Gathering Desktop App
This is my first project, which I developed during my cybersecurity training provided by the Azerbaijan Cybersecurity Center and Technion.
This desktop application allows users to gather comprehensive information about Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) using various online resources. By entering a CVE identifier, the application retrieves data from multiple sources such as Vulmon, NVD NIST, Exploit-DB, and others, providing users with detailed insights into the vulnerability.

**Features:**
Retrieves vulnerability details from Vulmon, NVD NIST, and Exploit-DB.
Displays vulnerability summary, Metasploit modules, GitHub repositories, recent articles, references, and more.
Automatically generates a Word document summarizing all gathered information for further analysis and documentation.
**Usage:**
Launch the application and enter the CVE identifier.
Click on the "Search" button to retrieve information from various sources.
View the collected data on the application interface.
Optionally, click on the "Save as Document" button to generate a Word document containing all gathered information.
**Note:** This application was developed for learning purposes as part of a project to streamline vulnerability analysis and documentation processes
